</div>

<p>The folding of the serviette may often be made complimentary to the
guest. Not only does “the Bridal” point out its special application;
but “the Crown,” “the Prince of Wales’s Feather,” and “the Mitre.” “The
Boat” is appropriate when a naval chief is the honored guest; “the
Colonne de Triomphe,” for the entertainment of a hero fresh from a new
victory; “the Victoria Regia” for a distinguished botanist, and “the
Fan” for a reigning belle, so may “the Cocked Hat” be made available
when a military hero is entertained, and “the Heraldic Rose” for a
guest whose hobby is with things that appertain to the board.</p>

<p>In the days of our forefathers the quantity and quality of the viands
were thought of more consideration than the appointments of the table.
Provided the hospitable board groaned beneath the combined weight of
substantial food and a silver service, the banquet was pronounced
magnificent. Now we have changed all that. The contents of the dishes
have become secondary in importance to the decorations. The eye must
be feasted as well as the palate. Heavy silver ornaments have given
place, or at least are associated with, vases of crystal and abundance
of flowers, with scent fountains and the choice fruit selected for
dessert. The folding of the serviette, or table napkin, was always
a matter of attention; at the present moment it is doubly so, when
the luxury of table decorations are carried to such an extent that
ingenuity is constantly on the strain, not only to produce every
possible variety of <i>cartes de menu</i>, but even fanciful stands to hold
them or the guests’ name-cards in a prominent position. The parlor maid
or the waiter, or the dainty mistress of the house herself, must look
to their laurels in the matter of folding serviettes, or the other
showy trifles placed on the board will cast the attractions of the
table napkin completely into the shade. To fold them well in the more
elaborate styles, it is necessary that they should be made of very
fine, but rather stout damask, starched more or less, quite fresh and
nearly new. Old damask, that is soft, will not take the more elaborate
forms. Each serviette, previous to folding it, should be laid on the
ironing-board damped with (raw) starch, smoothed with a hot iron,
and immediately folded whilst crisp and steaming. It not only folds
better, but preserves the form longer by such means; and unless this
is attended to designs like “the Fan,” “the Victoria Regia,” “the
Bridal,” and “the Colonne de Triomphe,” could not effectually be made.
“The Boat” and “the Basket” also require very stiff serviettes. The
serviettes must be exactly square, and pains taken to make the sides
perfectly even and true.

<h3><a name="ESCUTCHEON" id="ESCUTCHEON"></a>THE ESCUTCHEON.</h3>

<div class="figcontainer">
  <div class="figsub">
   <a id="ESCUTCHEON1-2" name="ESCUTCHEON1-2">
   <img src="images/image07a.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="229" /></a>

  <div class="figsub">
   <a><img  src="images/image07b.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="230" /></a>
   <p class="center"><big><b>Fig. 2.</b></big></p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>This is one of the easiest methods possible of ornamentally folding a
serviette, and we recommend a novice to commence with it. Indeed, we
have arranged the folding as progressively as possible. Although it
will sit more crisp and fresh in appearance if made with a fine new
well starched material, the Escutcheon can be made very well with old
or even crumpled damask, though, of course, serviettes should always
be scrupulously clean and smooth. First, fold the serviette in half
lengthwise; and then fold it in half again lengthwise, keeping the
edges to the lower end, which comes where in the diagram A A and B B
are marked (<a href="#ESCUTCHEON1-2">see fig. 1</a>). It is necessary
to be always very precise in making the folds, bringing the edges and
corners exactly to meet, a rule which applies to all the designs; but
without strict attention to which, the more elaborate patterns cannot
be represented.</p>

<p>Now turn over each end of the serviette (which you have already folded
in four), in the manner shown in fig. 1, creasing it quite flat. Then
take one of the ends and roll it up in the manner shown in <a href="#ESCUTCHEON1-2">fig. 2</a>,
from C to D. Take the other end, E, and roll it in the same way. It is to be
observed that these rolls are brought exactly to meet (not to overlap)
the triangle formed at the top. It is, however, necessary to remark
that the napkin is to be rolled in the reverse way from that apparent
in the illustration; that is, to be rolled <i>under</i> and not <i>over</i>,
a difference which must not be neglected. Keep the rolls one in each
hand, and with a twist of the wrist bring over the roll C, to the point F
(causing the fold marked by the dotted line), and with a twist of the
other wrist bring the roll up to the same point to match it. Then lay it
flat on the table, the rolls underneath (<a href="#ESCUTCHEON3-4">see fig. 3</a>),
and keeping them down with the hand, raise the other part and shape it
as shown in <a href="#ESCUTCHEON3-4">fig. 4</a>, and slip the dinner
roll in the hollow at the back.</p>

<h3><a name="CHESTNUT" id="CHESTNUT"></a>THE CHESTNUT POCKET.</h3>

<div class="figcontainer">
  <div class="figsub">
   <a id="CHESTNUT1-2" name="CHESTNUT1-2">

   <p class="center"><big><b>Fig. 2.</b></big></p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>Fold the serviette in half both ways, and open it again. Bring all the
corners to the centre. Turn it over and again bring all the corners
to the centre. Turn it back again and slip the chestnuts in the four
pockets to be observed in <a href="#CHESTNUT1-2">fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>Fig. 2, the Pocket Serviette, is made in the same way; but the corners
are brought three times, instead of twice, to the centre, turning it
each time (<a href="#CHESTNUT1-2">see fig. 2</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="SHIELD" id="SHIELD"></a>THE SHIELD.</h3>

<div class="figcontainer">
  <div class="figsub">
   <a id="SHIELD1-2" name="SHIELD1-2">

   <p class="center"><big><b>Fig. 2.</b></big></p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>The Shield is almost identical with the <a href="#ESCUTCHEON">Escutcheon</a>;
there is, however, a slight difference, which forms a little variety and practice
in the art of napkin-folding.</p>

<div class="figcontainer">
  <div class="figsub">
   <a id="SHIELD3-4" name="SHIELD3-4">
   <img src="images/image08e.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="190" /></a>

  <div class="figsub">

   <p class="center"><big><b>Fig. 4.</b></big></p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>First form <a href="#SHIELD1-2">fig. 1</a>, as for the Escutcheon. Next roll
up the two ends in the manner shown in <a href="#SHIELD1-2">fig. 2</a>; that is,
make the rolls outwardly, not under as in the previous direction. The serviette
will now resemble <a href="#SHIELD3-4">fig. 3</a>. Then set it into form, and place
the bread inside. The face of it will stand perfectly upright and
resemble <a href="#SHIELD3-4">figure 4</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="MITRE" id="MITRE"></a>THE MITRE.</h3>

<p>The Mitre is a well-known device, and one which always looks
effective. It is not unlike the Crown. Fold the damask in half,
and turn down the two corners to meet at both ends, in the manner
shown in <a href="#MITRE1-2">fig. 1</a>, taking care to let them
meet very exactly and not overlap. Fold it in half at the line A
to B, <a href="#MITRE1-2">fig. 1</a>, to ascertain the centre. Open
this last fold again and bring the two points to the centre like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<a href="#MITRE1-2">fig. 2</a>. Fold these together at the dotted line
with the points <i>outside</i>, let down one of these corners again, and
turn in the two points A and B also, to make a triangle uniform with
the others: it will now resemble <a href="#MITRE3-4">fig. 3</a>. Turn
the serviette over; let down the point on that side: it will then
resemble <a href="#MITRE3-4">fig. 4</a>. Turn in the corners A and B,
by the line marked. Turn up the point D to its former position: it will
now resemble <a href="#MITRE5-6">fig. 5</a>. Slip the hand inside the
hollow to be found at the broad end, and shape it like a cap, and the
Mitre is complete.</p>

<h3><a name="CORNUCOPIA" id="CORNUCOPIA"></a>THE CORNUCOPIA.</h3>

<p>Cornucopias are easily folded, and very effective down a long dinner
table, with a single scarlet geranium flower at the apex of each. Halve
the serviette lengthways; turn down the corners at the two ends to meet
in the centre and form a triangle, like <a href="#CROWN3-4">fig. 4, in the Crown</a>. Take
the corners at the base and bring them to the apex, like <a href="#CORNUCOPIA1-3">fig. 1</a>. Then
double it together with folds inside: it will now appear like <a href="#CORNUCOPIA1-3">fig. 2</a>.
At the side marked A, there are three folds. Set it upright over the
dinner roll, with two of these folds one side and one on the other.
Shape it nicely, keeping the space from B to C close.</p>

<h3><a name="CROWN" id="CROWN"></a>THE CROWN.</h3>

<p>This is a handsome design, and is one which requires very well starched
damask. The bread is placed inside, underneath the crown. Now that
flowers are so much used, nothing could have a more charming effect
than a slight wreath of flowers round the base of it, at the part
marked A to B, in <a href="#CROWN1-2">fig. 1</a>. <a href="#CROWN1-2">Fig. 2</a> represents the serviette laid on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
table. Fold it exactly in half from A to B, open and fold the reverse
way, from C to D. Open it again. These creases are merely made to
ascertain the true centre. At it lies, turn all the points to the
centre, and crease down in the manner observed in <a href="#CROWN3-4">fig. 3</a>, which forms
a diamond. Take the four corners of the diamond and fold them to the
centre again. The serviette will still preserve the shape shown in
diagram <a href="#CROWN3-4">fig. 3</a>, but be smaller in size. Bring the top, A, to the right
hand, B, and the left hand, B, to the other, A; it will now resemble
<a href="#CROWN3-4">Fig. 4</a>. Fold down the corners, E F and G H, parallel to the line I
J; it will now resemble <a href="#CROWN5">fig. 5</a>. Put the hand inside it at the broad
end, and shape it like a cap, over the hand, folding one end into the
other as shown at C, in <a href="#CROWN5">fig. 5</a>, The stiffness of the damask should be
sufficient to keep these last folds in place; the corner fold should
just be turned one corner within the other as an envelope, and pinched,
to secure its remaining firm.</p>

<p>The Scroll is simple to fold. It is represented complete (<a href="#SCROLL3">fig. 3</a>).
The bread is under the centre, on which the name card may be laid.
It does not require to be stiff. First fold the serviette four times
lengthways. Fold down one end in the manner shown at A, in <a href="#SCROLL1-2">fig. 2</a>.
Then fold the end A completely across, forming the line, B B. Roll up the
end A, and produce the <a href="#SCROLL3">fig. 3</a>. Treat the other side in the same way.
<a href="#SCROLL3">Fig. 3</a> illustrates the process. The space in the middle,
A, <a href="#SCROLL1-2">fig. 1</a>, is closed over the bread.

<p>The Slippers are very easy to make. Double the serviette four times
lengthways. Then fold like <a href="#SLIPPERS1-2">fig. 1</a>. The ends are simply rolled, taking
the corners in the method shown in <a href="#SLIPPERS1-2">fig. 2</a>; bringing them over as shown
in <a href="#SLIPPERS3">fig. 3</a>, and with another turn forming the Slippers
(<a href="#SLIPPERS4">fig. 4</a>). Secure the point at A, with the left hand, whilst
rolling up the other side; and then hold both points together with the left hand and
place the right in the top of the Slippers, setting them over the dinner roll,
which should be placed underneath at B, <a href="#SLIPPERS4">fig. 4</a>; and the Slippers
pinched close together at the top over it. A few flowers in the hollows
of the folds is a pretty addition.</p>

<p>Fold a serviette in half lengthways (<a href="#COCKED6-1-2">see fig. 1</a>), then in half again
(<a href="#COCKED6-1-2">fig. 2</a>). Fold it lengthways again, with the edges-inside, in the way
shown in fig. 3. Fold it in half lengthways at the dotted line with the
edges outside. Turn down the corners in the manner explained by <a href="#COCKED3-5">fig. 4</a>,
both sides alike; it now resembles <a href="#COCKED3-5">fig. 5</a>. Turn in the superfluous
end C, shown in <a href="#COCKED3-5">fig. 4</a>, inside the hat: this makes it resemble <a href="#COCKED6-1-2">fig. 6</a>.
Shape it with the hand and slip it over the dinner bread. If the edges
are left outside in folding (<a href="#COCKED3-5">fig. 3</a>), when finished, a space will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
offered at the top wherein a few flowers may be placed. A Boat may
also be folded by this diagram by reversing its position on the plate.
A still better way to make the Boat is to double a serviette in half
lengthways, and again the reverse way. Fold the two edges to the
centre: this makes an oblong. Turn it over on the other side. Turn two
of the corners to meet in the centre; must not be opposite corners,
but both at the right end. Turn the two left end corners half to the
middle. Iron down. Then fold the whole in half lengthways, having the
corners inside. This completes the Boat. Put the bread underneath.</p>

<p>The Boat is exceedingly pretty, especially if freighted with a few
flowers. The serviette should be well starched to sit firm and sharp,
and must be an exact square. First fold it in half like a shawl. Next
take the corner A (<a href="#ANOTHER1-3">fig. 1</a>), and bring it to C. Turn over the serviette
on the other side. Take the corner B, and bring it to C in the same
way, but on the other side: this forms <a href="#ANOTHER1-3">fig. 2</a>.
Fold <a href="#ANOTHER1-3">fig. 2</a> in half by the line in the centre,
bringing D to E, and forming <a href="#ANOTHER1-3">fig. 3</a>. Fold the
point F to H. Turn over the serviette and fold G to H, on the other
side; this produces <a href="#ANOTHER4-5">fig. 4</a>. Fold the half of the end J to K, producing
<a href="#ANOTHER4-5">fig. 5</a>. Fold L to K, on the other side. These folds must be so made as
to leave the upper part of the serviette, which will now again open and
look like <a href="#ANOTHER1-3">fig. 3</a>, from F to G. Slip the hand inside here, round it open
a little, and so bring F to meet G, making it flat the reverse way:
this is represented by <a href="#ANOTHER6-7">fig. 6</a>. Turn down the whole point M to N, on the
thinnest side, like <a href="#ANOTHER6-7">fig. 7</a>. Slip in the thumbs at the opening at O in
<a href="#ANOTHER6-7">fig. 7</a>, and holding the last fold firmly down; dexterously turning the
Boat inside out: the inside fold resembles a capital A. Pinch the sides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of the A the other way, making it an A again; and drawing out the
Boat lengthways. Shape it a little with the hand. The bread may be
slipped under the centre, A, or cabin of the Boat, provided it is not
too large. A pretty addition to this would be to attach the <i>carte de
menu</i>, by the means of a Chinese ribbon, to a chip, spill, or blender
stick, and fix it in the Boat as a sail. The name card may also be
attached to resemble an additional sail.</p>

the serviette in half lengthways. Turn down the corners like <a href="#HAMBURG1">fig. 1</a>,
fold it in half across the centre, inwards, from A to B, keeping the
corners inside. It will now resemble <a href="#HAMBURG2-4">fig. 2</a>. Fold it again from C to D,

F and G, to make a triangle uniform with the others: thus you have

<p>The Shell requires a very stiff serviette. Fold the two edges together
in the centre, lengthways, as shown in <a href="#SHELL1-3">fig. 1</a>. Fold in half down the
centre, also lengthways, leaving the edges outside. Then crimp evenly
in the manner shown in <a href="#SHELL1-3">fig. 2</a>. Open up the top end, and turn down the
edges each way, as they appear in <a href="#SHELL1-3">fig. 3</a>. Keep the lower ends together
like a fan. If well done, it can be balanced on the plate by the ends,
in the manner illustrated by <a href="#SHELL4">fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p>The fan is made precisely like the <a href="#SHELL">Shell</a>, only the edges are not turned
down; but in folding, at first, are kept inside. The fan is placed in a
glass, in the way shown in <a href="#FAN5">fig. 5</a>.</p>

<p>It is, also, sometimes folded again before crimping three parts up.
This forms a double Fan, and the lower one should be pulled out a
little by the fingers.

<h3><a name="ROSETTE" id="ROSETTE"></a>THE ROSETTE FAN.</h3>

<p>The Rosette Fan is very handsome and uncommon, but difficult to make,
requiring very nice manipulation. First fold the serviette in half,
lengthways, the edges downward. As it lays on the table, make it into
three equal folds, lengthways. Then take the upper fold between the
finger and thumb, lengthways, and the lower fold between the second
and third fingers of each hand. Bring the lower fold up to within an
inch and a half of the fold left, and the one between the finger and
thumb to within an inch and a half of that. The hemmed edges ought to
be an inch and a half below the last of the three plaits you have now
formed. Press them well down. Crimp as for the Rosette. Hold what would
be the handle of the Fan well in the left hand, and keep it all close
together. Insert right through the upper fold or plait the handle of a
silver fork, the flat way, and when right through, turn it, rounding
out the plait like a bullionné on a lady’s dress. Treat the other two
plaits in the same way. Then put the handle end firmly in a glass and
let the top spread out. The effect is excellent.</p>

<p>This spirited design is difficult to accomplish, and requires to be
very stiff indeed. Fold the serviette in half twice, lengthways,
keeping the hems to the edge. Then plait it <a href="#SHELL">as the Shell was plaited</a>,
in the way shown in <a href="#VICTORIA1-3">fig. 1</a>. The number of petals will depend on the
number of folds, which should be twice as many as were made for the
Shell, the width being only half as much. Keep the folds as close
together as possible, and begin forming the petals by drawing back the
first hem, <a href="#SHELL">as the edge of the Shell was done</a>. Proceed to turn down the
next fold and make another round of petals to meet the first ones, and
finish by making the last hem fold in the same way (<a href="#VICTORIA1-3">fig. 2</a>).
Set it round by bringing the two edges of the serviette together. It is not
at all easy to set the petals well. The bread is not to be placed in
or under it; but a single flower, such as a rose, may very properly be
slipped into the heart. <a href="#VICTORIA1-3">Fig. 3</a> represents the Victoria Regia, which
should be placed in the centre of the plate.</p>

<p>The Swan is a very simple fold, yet one requiring some knack to
produce. The serviette should be very stiff. <a href="#SWAN1">Form a triangle</a> by folding
it in half. Hold the point, A, between the teeth; take C and B in
each hand. Hold it tight across the chest, so that from A to D it is
strained tight against you. Roll up the ends B and C very tight, one in
each hand, in the manner shown in <a href="#SWAN2-3">fig. 2</a>. The reason it is held tight
across the chest is to keep it plain at E; otherwise it would curl up
to the top. Now bring the points B and C together (<a href="#SWAN2-3">fig. 2</a>). Bend over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the point A and shape the twisted pieces so as to give the appearance
of a Swan. Our illustration gives but a rough notion of it, as it is
not easy to delineate well on paper, and at the same time show the
way of bending it. With a little manipulation, a very good imitation
of a Swan may be produced. The centre piece is the head and neck; the
twisted portions represent the outline of the breast, body and the legs.</p>

<p>Lorgnettes are very easy indeed, and are a neat design. Fold the
serviette in half lengthways. Fold back an inch, or an inch and a
half, at the double end, and bring it to the centre, in the same way
observable in <a href="#LORGNETTE1">fig. 1</a>. Turn it over on the
other side and <a href="#LORGNETTE2-3">roll both ends</a>,
 one at a time, to the centre; taking care to press in with the
fingers, as it is rolled, the tendency is to bag up; so as to keep
it smooth outside, and the centre band tight. Stand it upright. The
Lorgnettes do not inclose the bread.</p>

<h3><a name="PYRAMID" id="PYRAMID"></a>THE PYRAMID.</h3>

<p>The Pyramid, provided the napkin is very stiff and fine, is easily
made. Double it in half one side within an inch of the other, so that
it may be more slender towards the point. Fold it in seven the narrow
way, like <a href="#SHELL1-3">fig. 3, in the shell</a>. Press these folds down with an iron;
then crimp them across with a paper knife, folding it in and out the
width of the knife. Lastly, join it round like a pyramid, and stand it
upright over the bread. For a bride, or a distinguished guest, slender
wreaths of flowers may be placed all round in every crimping.

</div>

<p>The Fleur-de-Lys should be folded with very stiff damask, a little
damp, and fresh ironed; but may be made with a small light damask,
without starch, by using a little pin at the back of the waist, marked
C to D in diagram (<a href="#FLEUR5">fig. 5</a>). Rich heavy damask of a large size is always
tiresome to fold without starch, although looking whiter, brighter,
and handsomer on table. Lay the serviette flat on the table: fold it
in half; and in half again, lengthwise; keeping the selvages all to
the top. Halve it the narrow way, A to B (<a href="#FLEUR1">fig. 1</a>). Merely make the
crease, and open this last fold again: thus you have the centre marked.
Take the ends E and D, and fold them to the centre: you thus have an
oblong, equal to two squares. Turn down the corner E, and you have a
resemblance to <a href="#FLEUR2-4">fig. 2</a>. Take the point D in that diagram, and bring it
to C. Take the point E and turn it under to C, in the way shown in
<a href="#FLEUR2-4">fig. 3</a>. Treat the point F in the same manner.
Thus <a href="#FLEUR2-4">fig. 4</a> is made. Double <a href="#FLEUR2-4">fig. 4</a>
in half, flat from A to B. Hold it tight between the thumb and
finger at C and D. Take hold of the points at A and pull them out
to resemble the petals of a Fleur-de-Lys, like <a href="#FLEUR5">fig. 5</a>. Turn up the
corners, E and F, at right angles to stand it upon, pinching the waist
well in. If not quite stiff enough to stand alone, after being pinched
a moment, place a pin at the back of the waist; but pins are always
better avoided.</p>

<h3><a name="ARCHBISHOP" id="ARCHBISHOP"></a>THE ARCHBISHOP’S, OR DOUBLE MITRE.</h3>

<p>The Archbishop’s, or Double Mitre, is exceedingly pretty, and may be
folded from any serviette. First fold the linen in half, and lay it
flat on the table. Turn down six inches from the top. Fold down an inch
and a half of this at the edge, and fold that over again; the folds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
forming an outside band like that shown in <a href="#ARCHBISHOP1-2">fig. 1</a>, from A to B. Raise
the ends A and B in the hand, and form the point C, in <a href="#ARCHBISHOP1-2">fig. 2</a>, allowing
the folds of the linen to overlap a little. Smooth it down flat,
without raising or moving it from the table; fold the lower end the
same, and bring it up to D E, in <a href="#ARCHBISHOP3">fig. 3</a>. Turn the fold D E, down on the
right side, and make another point with it like that at C, in <a href="#ARCHBISHOP1-2">fig. 2</a>,
but a little lower, so as to show the top point above it. Lastly, fold
up the lower edge F G, about an inch and a half, to form the band of
the Mitre. Bring the two ends F and G, round to the back, to make the
shape of a cap, and insert one in the other. If large enough, fit it
over the dinner roll. If not, set it on the table, and place the roll
upright in the hollow. The front should face the guest.</p>

<p>Take a very stiff square of damask, and fold it exactly in half. Open
and fold in half the reverse way. The centre is now ascertained. Fold
all the corners very exactly to the centre. Iron them down; turn over,
and again turn the corners to the centre. Turn the serviette over again
and take each corner from the centre, and fold it back at the half.
Then crease it from A to B (<a href="#FLOWER1-3">fig. 1</a>), open the crease, and fold it again
from C to D. Take it in the hand and bring the crease A to C, and C to
B, and so all round. This will enable you to make it stand. Hold the
apex between the fingers of one hand and square out the four sides.
This makes it resemble <a href="#FLOWER1-3">fig. 2</a>, and completes it. A few flowers should
be arranged in the compartments. For variety the corners may be left

<p>The <a href="#IMPERIAL3-4">Imperial Crown</a> requires very stiff damask—an exact square is

fold at <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>. Then fold the end, E F, to match. Then bring the
folded ends, A B, to the centre, <i>j</i>, crossing the folded part of one
over the other where they meet. The serviette will now look like <a href="#IMPERIAL1-2">fig. 2</a>.
Turn the fold, E F, to the back and fold down. Next bring the corner
E, by the dotted line K J, completely across, like <a href="#IMPERIAL3-4">fig. 3</a>; the end N
is to be level with the end E. The end N is then to be crossed over
to match, and the end of the band inserted in the folds of the other,
so as to hold firmly together. Put the hand inside and shape it. When
set over the dinner roll it will stand firm. It should be a full-sized

to meet in the centre. Turn that over, and turn down two corners not
at the selvage edge, at the lines A to B, and C to D. Turn it over and
it will resemble <a href="#DOUBLE1-2">fig. 1</a>. Take the end C, and roll it over to D
(<a href="#DOUBLE1-2">see fig. 2</a>). Bring A to B in the same manner, and complete the design. It

with holly or any bright flowers; or one space may be filled with holly
and the other with grapes, almonds, raisins, &amp;c., to represent plenty

<p>This is difficult to fold, although it may be done with a soft damask.
Starch is, however, an improvement. The secret of success depends
entirely on rolling it <i>very</i> lightly. Lay the serviette flat on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
table. From A to B (<a href="#COLONNE1-2">fig. 1</a>), fold down about six inches,
if it is a large serviette. After trying the fold once, by reference the
illustration, it will be seen if the proportion is properly kept. The
one which we have just folded ourselves, as a model, stands fifteen
inches high, eleven for the shaft of the column, and it is very erect
and firm, although made of limp damask. Fold the damask in half from
C to D (<a href="#COLONNE1-2">fig. 1</a>), to ascertain the half. In the left hand nip
up the corner E, as shown in the illustration; the centre C and the corner G
in the same way, like <a href="#COLONNE1-2">fig. 2</a>, shaping them into laurel leaves.
Then pleat down the serviette, holding the top still in the hand, in the
way described in <a href="#COLONNE3-4">fig. 3</a>. Next take the
end H (<a href="#COLONNE1-2">fig. 2</a>), that is, the
left hand lower corner, and pass it completely round the serviette to
the right, bringing the selvage tight around A to B in <a href="#COLONNE3-4">fig. 3</a>.
Lay it on the table, holding the neck at E grasped in the hand, at first; and
tucking down and keeping tight the folds from C to D (<a href="#COLONNE3-4">fig. 4</a>),
whilst rolling over the end E to F, as tightly as possible, umbrella wise;
pressing it on the table as you roll it up, to keep it firm. Fasten the
end with a little pin. Then firmly tuck in the odd corners at the base,
in the way half a pound of sugar or an ounce of almonds are turned in.
Twine a wreath of flowers around it. The artificial wreaths of small
roses or holly, sold at the grocers’, are pretty for the purpose. Set
it upright, and with a little manipulation it will sit firm in the plate.</p>

<h3><a name="TULIP" id="TULIP"></a>THE TULIP.</h3>

<p>The Tulip requires a very stiff material. The folds are very simple,
but requires nicety of fingering and pressure with a hot iron. Bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
all the corners to the centre, as for the <a href="#CROWN">Crown</a>. Bring the corners down
to the centre again and again; in all five times. Press it well. Finish
all the serviettes to be folded so far, and then recommence with the
first by turning down all the corners one by one, to form the Tulip
petals, which should hang down in long points, like a dog’s ears. Place
the Tulip on a glass.</p>

<p>The Bridal Serviette is almost identical with the <a href="#PYRAMID">Pyramid</a>,
and is so called because it is a favorite for wedding breakfasts. At the top it
is to be decorated with a few flowers. For the bride, stephanotis,
white roses, or any white flowers available, mixed with a little orange
blossom. For the other guests a scarlet flower. The serviette must be
very stiff and damp from fresh ironing. Lay it on the table flat. Fold
it not in half, but within an inch and a half of the top (<a href="#BRIDAL1-2">see fig. 1</a>).
Take the corners A and B, and fold them to C and D again, within
an inch and a half of the last fold, and like the last fold flat and
straight across. This produces <a href="#BRIDAL1-2">fig. 2</a>. Again take the ends
E and F and fold over to G and H, within an inch and a half of the last fold. This
will probably about halve the remaining piece; but that will depend on
the size of the serviette. Then fold it the narrow way, backwards and
forwards, as for a fan, nine times, creasing it firmly down. Opening it
as little as possible, turn down all the tops of the folds in the way
noticed in <a href="#BRIDAL3">fig. 3</a>, beginning at the top of the three tiers. Then join
it round, fixing the first fold over the last, and pinch it together at
the top.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales’s Feather is a perfectly new design, invented
especially for the present work. It is simple in effect and very
handsome in appearance. It requires a very stiff crisp serviette. Lay
the damask on the table, ironing it damp. Fold it from <a href="#CROWN1-2">fig. 2
in the Crown</a>, from A to B, using the hot iron to crease it. Without disturbing
this fold, crease in half again the reverse way, from C to D, thus
reducing the size to a quarter. Smooth it with the iron. Next fold
this in half diagonally, like <a href="#CROWN3-4">fig. 4 in the Crown</a>.
Observe <a href="#FEATHER4-6">fig. 4</a>, in
the illustrations on the present page, carefully. Fold it in half from
A to B, using the iron; this will produce <a href="#FEATHER1-3">fig. 2</a>. Make the fold C to
B, on one side only, in the manner shown in <a href="#FEATHER1-3">fig. 3</a>. Then fold it back
again at the dotted line D, and it will resemble <a href="#FEATHER4-6">fig. 4</a>. Fold the other
side to match, always using the iron to press every fold. Open it and
it will resemble <a href="#FEATHER4-6">fig. 5</a>, with the folds A, C, D. Make the folds, E, as
shown in <a href="#FEATHER4-6">fig. 5</a>, taking care not to flatten the other folds, leaving
the serviette only just open enough to make the folds, E, each side. It
now resembles <a href="#FEATHER4-6">fig. 6</a>. Bring the last two folds quite flat and inside
C and D, and it will resemble <a href="#FEATHER7-9">fig. 7</a>. Treat the other side the same,
and then fold it in half in the middle, A, and it will resemble <a href="#FEATHER7-9">fig. 8</a>.
Now allow it to open a little and hold it by the apex, B, <a href="#FEATHER7-9">fig. 9</a>.
Keep it very much indented in the centre (A to B); bring the wings or
side feathers forward, and curl over the three lips of the feather by
bending them with the fingers. Place it upright in a wine glass or a
slender single flower glass in the same manner as the Fan is placed.

<p class="f150 space-above2">Preface to Whitehead’s No. 4 Cooking for Profit.</p>

<p>This book is in many respects a continuation of the preceding volumes
in the series, it fulfills the designs that were intended but not
finished before, more particularly in the second part which deals
with the cost of keeping up a table. It is not an argument either for
or against high prices, but it embodies in print for the first time
the methods of close-cutting management which a million of successful
boarding house and hotel-keepers are already practising, in order that
another million who are not successful may learn, if they will, wherein
their competitors have the advantage. At the time when the following
introduction was written, which was about four years before the finish,
I was just setting out, while indulging a rambling propensity, to
find out why it was that my hotel books which were proving admirably
adapted to the use of the ten hotels of a resort town were voted “too
rich for the blood” of the four hundred boarding-houses; also, it
was a question how so many of these houses running at low prices are
enabled to make money as easily as the hotels which have a much larger
income. At the same time some statistician published a statement that
attracted attention showing that the vast majority of the people of
this land have to live on an income of less than fifty cents a day. At
the same time also an English author published a little book, which,
however, I have not seen and did not need, with the title of “How to
live on sixpence a day,” (twelve cents) which was presumptive evidence
that it could be done. In quest of information on these points I went
around considerably and found a good many “Mrs. Tingees” who were not
keeping boarding-houses, and I honor them for the surpassing skill that
makes the fifty cents a day do such wonders; but the right vein was not
struck until the opportunity occurred to do both the buying and using
of provisions from the very first meal in a Summer Boarding House.</p>

<p>In reference to unfinished work I take the liberty here of saying that
the bills of fare in this book with the quantities and proportions and
relative cost from the continuation and complete illustration of an
article entitled “The Art of Catering” in <i>Hotel Meat Cooking</i>. Knowing
how much to cook, how much to charge, how to prevent waste and all such
questions raised there are carried out to an answer in these pages. In
regard to the use of French names for dishes it is necessary that a
statement should be made. A great reform has taken place in the last
ten years in the composition of hotel bills of fare, and the subject
matter of these books having been widely diffused by publication
in the hotel newspapers, has undoubtedly had much to do with the
improvement that is now observable. My own design was, however, to
explain French terms, give their origin and proper spelling, and to
that end I had a mass of anecdotes, historical mention and other
such material collected to make the explanations interesting. As a
preliminary, I began exposing the absurdities committed by ignorant
cooks and others trying to write French, and before this had proceeded
far the newspapers took up and advocated the idea that French terms
should be abolished altogether. If that was to be the way the knot of
misspelling and misnaming dishes was to be cut, there was no use for my
dictionary work and the material was thrown away; I followed the new
path and it proves a plain and sensible one. At the same time there is
an aspect of the subject which cooks seeking situations perceive and
editors of newspapers may never think of, and that is that there are
many employers whom the reform has not reached who will pay a hundred
dollars for a cook who can give his dishes imposing foreign names more
willingly than fifty dollars to a better cook who can only write United
States. First class hotels which have all the good things that come to
market avoid French terms. They that have turkey and lamb, chicken,
peas and asparagus, oysters and turtle and cream want them shown up
in the plainest reading; to cover them up with French names would be
injudicious; but if we have but the same beef and mutton every day, the
aid that a few ornamental terms can give is not to be despised. First
of all it is requisite that those who use such terms should know what
they are intended to indicate and how they should be spelled and then
they can be taken or left according to the intelligent judgment of
those concerned.</p>
